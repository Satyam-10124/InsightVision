# InsightVision: Detect, Analyze, Summarize üöÄ

**InsightVision** is a powerful AI-powered application designed to detect objects within images, analyze the scene, and generate a summary with the object counts. Additionally, it provides a scene description based on the detected objects. This tool is perfect for understanding complex images and gaining valuable insights from them.

## üîß Built Using:

- **YOLOv5**: A cutting-edge object detection model for identifying objects in images.
- **Gradio**: For creating a user-friendly web interface.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **Torch**: For deep learning model handling.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to implement the application.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: For image processing and displaying images.

## üåü Key Features:

1. **Object Detection**:
   - Automatically detects objects in uploaded images using YOLOv5.
   - Supports common objects like people, vehicles, animals, and more.

2. **Scene Summarization**:
   - Provides a textual summary of the detected objects along with their counts.
   - Offers insights into the scene based on the object count and types.

3. **Scene Description**:
   - Automatically generates a scene description based on the detected objects, helping users understand the context of the image.

4. **Animated Gradient Background**:
   - Features an aesthetically pleasing animated gradient background that enhances the user experience.

5. **Interactive Web Interface**:
   - Easy-to-use web interface built with Gradio.
   - Upload images, capture from webcam, or paste from clipboard to get results instantly.

6. **Object Count**:
   - Displays the count of detected objects, making it easier to analyze object distribution within the image.

## üì∏ Image Upload Options:

InsightVision allows three ways to provide images:

- **Upload from File**: You can upload an image directly from your device.
- **Capture from Webcam**: Capture a live image using your device's webcam.
- **Paste from Clipboard**: Paste an image directly from your clipboard into the app.

These features make it easy for users to interact with the app and use it in various contexts, whether for a static image, a real-time capture, or pasting an image they've copied.

## üöÄ Deployment Guide:

Follow these steps to deploy the **InsightVision** app:

1. **Create a Space on Hugging Face**:
   - Log in to Hugging Face and create a new Space for the application.

2. **Upload Files**:
   - Upload the following files to the Hugging Face Space:
     - `app.py` (Main application file)
     - `requirements.txt` (Dependencies file)

3. **Set Up Requirements**:
   - Add the following dependencies to `requirements.txt`:
     ```txt
     gradio
     torch
     opencv-python-headless
     numpy
     pillow
     ```

4. **Store API Keys** (Optional):
   - If your app requires API keys for additional functionality, store them securely in the **Secrets** section of Hugging Face.

5. **Launch the Space**:
   - Once the files are uploaded and dependencies are set up, launch your Space, and the application will be live!
